# JDBC_Game
This is a Mini Project which I have developed using JAVA and JDBC, where we can give input some random numbers. Then system will generate some random numbers, if our number and system generated numbers are same then our score will increase each time by 10 point , otherwise score will decrease. Then adding these data and time in Database using JDBC.
